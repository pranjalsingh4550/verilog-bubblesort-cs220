# A Simple processor in the Verilog Language
Done as a part of CS220 - Computer Organisation in the Winter 2023 semester (2022-23, second semester).

## Oveview
 - Single-cycle execution of instructions
 - Implemented arithmetic, logical, conditional branch and unconditional jump instructions. To my knowledge, the instruction set is Turing-complete.
 - Harvard Architecture - instructions and data were hard-coded into the memory, as in veda.v.
 - Done in a group of two.
 - Thanks to Professor Urbi Chatterjee for explaining most of the working in a lecture.

For details, please refer to the Implementation report.
To execute the program, run cu_tb.v and view the last five words in the ext_memory module in the VCD file.
